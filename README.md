# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the **Random Forest Classifier**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to explore which features were most influential in determining survival. It involves data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and training a classification model.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It contains information about Titanic passengers such as age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and transformation

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualizing survival rates by gender, class, age, etc.
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features (e.g., Title from Name, Family Size)
   - Dropping irrelevant columns

4. **Model Building**
   - Applied **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Model tuning and validation

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Cross-validation

## ✅ Results

The **Random Forest** model performed well, capturing non-linear patterns and feature interactions, making it a strong choice for this classification problem.

> *Achieved an accuracy of: 82.12
